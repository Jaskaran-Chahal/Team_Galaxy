#### SkyBox:
Our skybox is based on ARM software OpenGL ES SDK for android. It is a "collection of resources to help you build OpenGL ES applications for a platform with a Mali GPU and an ARM processor. You can use it for creating new applications, training, and exploration of implementation possibilities." This SDK has many samples, tutorials, that one can use for their own projects, including a skybox sample. 

When running, you will need an ARM based device that can run it. On Android Studio, you will need to make a virtual device that is based on ARM. This is simple to do. You will need to create a virtual device and when selecting the system image, you will need to go into "Other Images" tab and select an ARM ABI and that's it. Another option is to use physical device. I(Raul) did not use a virtual device. I used my phone which is a Samsung Galaxy S10 and it ran perfectly.
